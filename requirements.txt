# Requirements for the LUS‑AI‑App
#
# This project uses Streamlit for the web interface, Hugging Face's
# transformers for loading pre‑trained vision models, and OpenCV to
# implement a simple B‑line detector. Additional libraries include
# Pillow for image handling and NumPy for numerical operations.
